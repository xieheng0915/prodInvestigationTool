Adobe Campaign allows you to send personalized and segmented push notifications to iOS and Android mobile devices. These messages are received on mobile applications that you set up in Adobe Campaign by leveraging the Experience Platform SDK.

This resource needs to be extended to collect data you intend to send from the mobile device to Adobe Campaign. To do so, refer to this page for the detailed steps. Two types of push notification are available in Adobe Campaign:      Alert/Message/Badge type notifications enable you to send standard text-based messages with additional content (sound, badge, deeplink, etc.) that you can define in the Advanced options section. This notification types allow you to add a title and a message in which you can use personalization fields. To be able to personalize your message, make sure you select the Send push on profiles template.   Silent push type notifications are used to silently notify the application without any message or content for the end user. A typical use case for this type of message would be to make the application aware that there is content available on the server to be downloaded.      Some specific configurations can be set up to define notifications behavior. For more on this, refer to this section.   NOTE   Laws concerning privacy differ by country.
